<h2>What is the Expertise Marketplace?</h2>

<p>The <strong>Expertise Marketplace</strong> is an internal web application designed to help employees discover and connect with colleagues who have specific skills and expertise across the organization. Think of it as an "internal LinkedIn" that makes it easy to find the right person for any project, question, or collaboration.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Why Do We Need This?</h2>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>In large organizations, valuable expertise often goes untapped because employees simply don't know who has the skills they need. This leads to:</p>

<ul>
<li>⏰ <strong>Wasted time</strong> searching for the right person to help</li>
<li>🔄 <strong>Duplicated efforts</strong> when people solve problems others have already solved</li>
<li>🚧 <strong>Siloed knowledge</strong> trapped within departments</li>
<li>📉 <strong>Missed collaboration opportunities</strong> between affiliates</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>The Expertise Marketplace creates a searchable, up-to-date directory of employee skills, making it easy to:</p>

<ul>
<li>🔍 <strong>Find experts instantly</strong> by searching for specific skills</li>
<li>🤝 <strong>Connect across departments</strong> and affiliate organizations</li>
<li>💡 <strong>Share knowledge</strong> and reduce duplicated work</li>
<li>📈 <strong>Accelerate projects</strong> by quickly assembling the right team</li>
</ul>
